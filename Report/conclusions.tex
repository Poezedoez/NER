\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}
The high recall in the evaluation results indicates that Frog is very capable in retrieving all relevant entities in a text. Type assignment, however, has appeared to be substantually more difficult. As a solution, reclassification of entity types has been proposed, and has proven to  increase overall type-precision. The semi-automatic construction of a parliamentary gazetteer as auxilliary, makes Frog well suitable for the NER-task required for the suggested system. Since a semi-automatic gazetteer can be constructed for any given domain, in addition to the fact that majority voting is domain-independent, Frog can be exported to similar Dutch NER-tasks.
